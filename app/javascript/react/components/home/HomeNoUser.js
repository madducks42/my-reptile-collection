        <p className="mb-6">As an avid reptile keeper for over two decades I&apos;ve used multiple tools and sites over the years to keep track of all my scaly critters. Every tool I used had some merits but was always lacking in one area. I started My Reptile Collection as a personal project to keep records of the snakes in my collection. I wanted something that would record all the purchasing history, lineage/morph information, breeding records, and typical health information like feeding history.</p>
        <p>This app is still a work in progress and I think it always will be as I never stop trying to make things better. If there a feature you&apos;d like to see or a bug you&apos;ve noticed, please send me a message and I&apos;ll look into it!</p>
